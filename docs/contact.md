### More general topics and suggestions

During the transfer of the STM32duinoforum from Roger Clark to STM the old
STM8 board got lost somehow, but the old postings are archived and still
[readable](https://stm32duinoforum.com/forum/viewforum_f_52.html). There is a
[new STM8 board](https://www.stm32duino.com/viewforum.php?f=76) in the
stm32duino forum. I was re-started on Oktober 2020, so there aren't many
messages there yet. is not much going on there, but it is still the place to
go to.
